# Creating-a-homelab-server-in-VirtualBox
This is a project documenting my process with making a personal homelab server to use as an alternative for google drive and to learn how to use new technology features. These are video documentation for my project. I'm using Virtualbox for this project because I actual home server is already settup and I want to document the setup for the project.
